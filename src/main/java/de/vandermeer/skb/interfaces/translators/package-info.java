/**
 * API for translators for characters, HTML Elements, and their combinations for several targets (Text, ADoc, LaTeX, HTML).
 * 
 * 
 * == The Problem
 * UTF-8 should be standard when dealing with text.
 * However, there are (still, and probably for a long time to come) many use cases where non-UTF-8 text needs to be processed.
 * Some examples are:
 * 
 * * Text in databases or other sources might be using ASCII encoding and HTML entities,
 * * Many text written for LaTeX is using 7-bit ASCII encoding with special commands for non-ASCII characters, and
 * * Legacy HTML text might use HTML Entities rather than UTF-8 encoded characters.
 * 
 * When dealing with multiple targets (for instance LaTex, AsciiDoc, and HTML), character translation can become a nightmare.
 * When defining the format of a normative source, all source representations must be translated to the required target representations.
 * 
 * Those translations can be very tricky, since they might require many target-specific exceptions.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * == This Solution
 * Use the SKB data for character maps and HTML Elements (https://github.com/vdmeer/skb[SKB on Github]) plus the SKB DataTool (https://github.com/vdmeer/skb-java-datatool[DataTool on Github]) to generate several translators that (hopefully) will ease the translation problems described above.
 * The SKB data provides for character maps and HTML Element maps.
 * Those maps are then used by the SKB DataTool to generate several Java classes with pre-defined mappings for this package.
 * 
 * There are three assumptions to translate a normative text as source to a target: characters, text formatting, and a combination of both.
 * 
 * 
 * === Translating Characters
 * We assume that all characters are written in UTF-8.
 * For instance, to write a German umlaut `ö` one would one simply write ö.
 * Those UTF-8 characters will need then to be translated to a proper target representation.
 * 
 * For any other UTF-8 bases target, the example `ö` will just be the same: ö.
 * If the target requires a different representation, we need to translate the `ö` to the target, e.g.:
 * 
 * * for an ASCII 7-bit representation in LaTeX we need to translate it to `\"{o}`.
 * * for an ASCII 7-bit representation in HTML we need to translate it to `&amp;ouml;`.
 * 
 * This package provides character translators for doing exactly that.
 * 
 * 
 * === Translating Text Formatting
 * 
 * Beside characters, the normative text source should also include standard formatting of text, such as bold and italic.
 * Simple text markup languages (such as AsciiDoc) and LaTeX use tags that are very hard to parse.
 * HTML however uses formatting tags that can be easily parsed and translated.
 * 
 * For instance, to mark text as bold in HTML one would use `<b>` and `</b>`.
 * Using this HTML markup, we can write text for instance as follows:
 * 
 * * for bold, write `<b>text in bold</b>` and translate it to LaTeX as `\textbf{text in bold}` and to AsciiDoc as ` +text in bold+ `,
 * * for italic, write `<i>text in italic</i>` and translate it to LaTeX as `\textit{text in italic}` and to AsciiDoc as ` +text in italic+ `.
 * 
 * This package provides translators for doing exactly that.
 * 
 * 
 * === Combination of Character and Text Formatting Translations
 * When combining both, character and text formatting translations, a few special cases do apply.
 * If we would simply translate all characters from source to target we would lose the text formatting.
 * 
 * For instance, the text
 * 
 * ----
 * ä ö <b>ü</b>
 * ----
 * 
 * will be translated to LaTeX as
 * 
 * ----
 * \"{a} \"{o} \textlessb\textgreater\"{u}\textless/b\textgreater
 * ----
 * 
 * To keep the text formatting,
 * we first need to convert those formatting markups into a representation that is not picked up by the simple character translation (a temporary form),
 * then realize the character translation, and then translate the temporary form of the formatting markup to the target representation.
 * This package provides translators for doing exactly that, resulting in a translated text of:
 * 
 * ----
 * \"{a} \"{o} \textbf{\"{u}}
 * ----
 * 
 * 
 * === Not everything will get translated
 * As mentioned above, the character and formatting translators are automatically generated.
 * While the data source (https://github.com/vdmeer/skb[SKB on Github]) defines quite a few translations, it also might (will) miss some required translations.
 * Over time, we hope that all required translations will be defined in the data source.
 * 
 * 
 * == Features
 * This package provides three different types of translators, each providing different translation classes for different target:
 * * Simple character translators,
 * * Simple formatting translators (using HTML Elements), and
 * * Combined translators.
 * 
 * 
 * === Character Translators
 * Character translators all provide a method `translateCharacters(String input)` translating all source character representations found in `input` to a target representation.
 * The translations provided currently are:
 * 
 * * Text to AsciiDoc (ADoc),
 * * Text to HTML,
 * * Text to LaTeX,
 * * HTML to AsciiDoc (ADoc), and
 * * HTML to LaTeX.
 * 
 * 
 * === HTML Element (text formatting) Translators
 * HTML Element translators all provide methods for:
 * 
 * * Translating a text to a temporary representation - `text2tmp(String input)`,
 * * Translating a temporary representation to a target representation - `tmp2target(String input)`, and
 * * Directly translating from source to target - `translateHtmlElements(String input)`.
 * 
 * The translations provided currently are:

 * * Text to AsciiDoc (ADoc),
 * * Text to HTML, and 
 * * Text to LaTeX.
 * 
 * 
 * === Combined Translators
 * Combined translators provide all methods from the two above described translator interfaces plus a method for a combined translation called `translate(String input)`.
 * 
 * The translations provided currently are:
 * 
 * * Text to AsciiDoc (ADoc),
 * * Text to HTML, and 
 * * Text to LaTeX.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * == Examples
 * 
 * === Character Translations
 * The following code will take a given string with some UTF-8 characters and translate it to a number of targets.
 * The first line creates a UTF-8 string.
 * The following lines print out translations to AsciiDoc, HTML, and LaTeX.
 * 
 * ----
 * String text = "ä ö ü Š β … € ™ ↔";
 * System.out.println(new Text2AsciiDoc().translateCharacters(text));
 * System.out.println(new Text2Html().translateCharacters(text));
 * System.out.println(new Text2Latex().translateCharacters(text));
 * ----
 * 
 * The output of the example will be as follows.
 * Line one below shows the translation to AsciiDoc.
 * Line two shows the translation to HTML.
 * Line three shows the translation to LaTeX.
 * 
 * ----
 * ä ö ü Š β … € ™ ↔
 * &auml; &ouml; &uuml; &Scaron; &beta; &hellip; &euro; &trade; &harr;
 * \"{a} \"{o} \"{u} \v{S} \beta {\dots} {\euro} {\texttrademark} \(\leftrightarrow{}\)
 * ----
 * 
 * 
 * === HTML Element (text formatting) Translations
 * The following code will take a given string with some formatting (HTML Elements) and translate it to a number of targets.
 * The first line creates a string with HTML Elements used for formatting.
 * The following lines print out translations to AsciiDoc, HTML, and LaTeX.
 * 
 * ----
 * String text = "<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, H<sub>2</sub>O, x<sup>y</sup>";
 * System.out.println(new de.vandermeer.translation.helements.Text2AsciiDoc().translateHtmlElements(text));
 * System.out.println(new de.vandermeer.translation.helements.Text2Html().translateHtmlElements(text));
 * System.out.println(new de.vandermeer.translation.helements.Text2Latex().translateHtmlElements(text));
 * ----
 * 
 * The output of the example will be as follows.
 * Line one below shows the translation to AsciiDoc.
 * Line two shows the translation to HTML.
 * Line three shows the translation to LaTeX.
 * 
 * ----
 * *bold*, _italic_, H_2O, x^y
 * <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, H<sub>2</sub>O, x<sup>y</sup>
 * \textbf{bold}, \textit{italic}, H$_{2}$O, x$^{y}$
 * ----
 * 
 * 
 * === Combined Translators
 * The following example will take a given string with character and formatting  and translate it to a number of targets.
 * The first line has the actual string with combined elements.
 * The following lines print out translations to AsciiDoc, HTML, and LaTeX.
 * 
 * ----
 * String text = "<b>bold ä ö ü</b>, <i>italic Š β …</i>, €<sub>5</sub>O, ™<sup>↔</sup>";
 * System.out.println(new de.vandermeer.translation.combinations.Text2AsciiDoc().translate(text));
 * System.out.println(new de.vandermeer.translation.combinations.Text2Html().translate(text));
 * System.out.println(new de.vandermeer.translation.combinations.Text2Latex().translate(text));
 * ----
 * 
 * The output of the example will be as follows.
 * Line one below shows the translation to AsciiDoc.
 * Line two shows the translation to HTML.
 * Line three shows the translation to LaTeX.
 * 
 * ----
 * *bold ä ö ü*, _italic Š β …_, €_5O, ™^↔
 * <b>bold &auml; &ouml; &uuml;</b>, <i>italic &Scaron; &beta; &hellip;</i>, &euro;<sub>5</sub>O, &trade;<sup>&harr;</sup>
 * \textbf{bold \"{a} \"{o} \"{u}}, \textit{italic \v{S} \beta {\dots}}, {\euro}$_{5}$O, {\texttrademark}$^{\(\leftrightarrow{}\)}$
